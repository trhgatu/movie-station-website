# Movie Station Website

A modern movie station website built with **Next.js** and **React**, integrated with **TMDB API** and **2Embed** for seamless streaming of movies and TV shows.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework that supports server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) to enhance SEO and performance.
- **React**: A component-based JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that speeds up the development process with a responsive and customizable design system.
- **Framer Motion**: A library used to create smooth animations and transitions in React components.
- **Swiper**: A popular carousel library for creating interactive and touch-friendly slide components.

### API:
- **TMDB API** (The Movie Database API): Provides access to a vast movie and TV show database, offering details like posters, overviews, trailers, and more. It powers the content shown on the site, such as popular movies, upcoming releases, and detailed film information.

### 2Embed Integration
The website also integrates with **2Embed**, a third-party service that simplifies embedding movie and TV show streams directly on the platform, offering a smooth and hassle-free viewing experience.

#### How It Works:
- **Movie Streaming**: For movies, the website fetches an embed URL from 2Embed, which is inserted into an iframe for seamless streaming within the site.
- **TV Show Streaming**: For TV shows, 2Embed provides embed URLs that include details for specific seasons and episodes. The website dynamically constructs these URLs based on the selected season and episode, allowing users to watch TV episodes effortlessly.
  
#### Benefits:
- **Convenience**: Users can stream movies and TV shows directly on the website without being redirected to other platforms.
- **High-Quality Streams**: 2Embed ensures that the content is streamed with minimal interruptions, providing high-quality video playback.
